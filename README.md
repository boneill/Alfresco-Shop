Alfresco Shopfront Addon
The Alfresco Shopfront Addon turns Alfresco into an eCommerce site.  Shoppers can use Alfresco to find content by either browsing or searching and add content to a shopping cart.  Users cannot download content unless they have purchased it.  On Checkout, users are directed to a Credit Card payment checkout page so that they can pay for the content.  Once paid for the users can download or print out the content items they have purchased
